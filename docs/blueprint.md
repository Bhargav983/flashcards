# **App Name**: Flashcard Fun

## Core Features:

- Flashcard Generation: Generate a single flashcard image based on user request.  Each image contains a single realistic fruit centered on a plain white background. No text, no borders, no background clutter. Uses a tool to decide if the generated image follows all of the guidelines.
- Image Display: Display the flashcard image in a large, clear format, optimized for infant viewing on various devices.
- Simple Navigation: Navigate between flashcards using simple swipe gestures or large, easily tappable buttons.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary background color: Plain white (#FFFFFF) for maximum contrast.
- Accent color: Use a soft, muted blue (#ADD8E6) for buttons and navigation elements to provide a gentle contrast without overwhelming the images.
- Ensure a clean and uncluttered layout with the fruit image prominently displayed in the center.
- Use subtle, gentle transitions between flashcards to maintain the infant's attention without overstimulation.
- Use simple, intuitive icons for navigation (e.g., left/right arrows) that are easy for parents to understand.
